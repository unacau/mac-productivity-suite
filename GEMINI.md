# Project: Khomyak (Хомяк) — macOS Productivity Suite (v1.0.0)

## Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Target Platform**: macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma, Sequoia, Tahoe).
- **Primary Engine (Swift 6+)**: 100% Pure Native Standalone App (`src/ChromeQuickAccess`) using SwiftUI, AppKit bridging, CoreGraphics `CGEvent` taps, and driverless IOHID remapping.
  - `Engine/KeyCodes.swift`: Virtual keycode definitions and Carbon/AppKit key lookup.
  - `Engine/CapsLockEngine.swift`: Driverless hardware remapping via `hidutil` (Caps-Lock -> F18) and head-insert `CGEventTap` for dedicated application switching modifiers (without green LED blinking).
  - `Engine/AppGroupEngine.swift`: Universal Pinned Quick Apps (4 slots max: Terminal, IDE, AI Agent, Notes), home-row shortcuts (`T`, `I`, `A`, `N`, `C`), letter cycling submenus, dynamic alphabet catalog, and 1-click slot replacement.
  - `Engine/ChromeProfileEngine.swift`: Dynamic Chromium `Local State` discovery, monogram avatar rendering, native macOS Accessibility (`AXUIElement`) menu bar profile switching, and window raising.
  - `Engine/AntigravityEngine.swift`: Discovery and fast cycling for Antigravity & Antigravity IDE.
  - `Engine/CopyOnSelectEngine.swift`: Linux/X11-style automatic clipboard copying on text drag selection (>10pt) and multi-click selection.
  - `Engine/LicenseEngine.swift`: Polar.sh online license verification via non-blocking async `Task` on `@MainActor`, offline caching, and checkout redirection.
  - `Engine/XomskyMotion.swift`: Procedural mascot micro-interactions (blinking, breathing, peek easter egg) using SwiftUI springs.
  - `Views/MinimalHUDWindow.swift`: Non-activating floating bezel HUD overlay with profile avatars and active card indicators.
  - `Views/CopyToastWindow.swift`: Non-intrusive cursor-following HUD toast for copy confirmation with rapid auto-dismiss (<1.2s).
  - `AppDelegate.swift`: Menu bar status item, hotkey routing, and lifecycle management.
  - `main.swift`: Standard native application entry point.

## Key Build, Verification & Operations Commands
- **Run All Tests**: `make test` or `./tests/run_tests.sh` or `swift test`.
- **System Health & Diagnostics**: `make health` or `./scripts/health_check.sh` (3-point validation).
- **Semantic Version Bumping**: `make bump-patch`, `make bump-minor`, `make bump-major` (Synchronizes `VERSION.txt`, `BUILD.txt`, and `Info.plist`).
- **Telemetry & Direct Log Ingestion**:
  - `make monitor`: Real-time streaming from macOS Unified Logging (`os_log` subsystem `com.almosteleven.xomsky`).
  - `make diagnostics`: Aggregated log level and category distribution summary over the last hour.
  - `./scripts/monitor_telemetry.sh errors 30m`: Filter errors and faults directly from system log stream.
- **Validation & Quality Gates**: `make validate` (verifies version synchronization and shell script syntax).
- **Build Native App**: `make native` or `./build_native_app.sh` (Produces universal Mach-O binary & DMG).
- **Generate Checksums**: `make checksums` (Produces SHA-256 `dist/checksums.txt`).
- **Local Installation**: `make install` or `./install.sh` (Installs native app to `/Applications`).
- **Release Automation**: `./release.sh --push` (creates git tag & triggers GitHub Actions cloud release pipeline) or `./release.sh --local` (local build + `gh release create`).

## Code Conventions & Standards
- **Swift & SwiftUI**:
  - Strictly adhere to Swift 6 modern concurrency patterns (`async`/`await`, `@MainActor`, `Sendable`). Avoid legacy GCD / `DispatchQueue` where possible.
  - **Strict Concurrency Captures**: When using `[weak self]` inside a concurrent `@MainActor` `Task`, always safely bind it first (`guard let engine = self else { return }`). Do not pass `self?` directly into the `Task` block.
  - **Explicit Module Imports**: Always include explicit `import AppKit` alongside `import Cocoa` when referencing types like `NSImage`.
  - **Sub-process Execution & ARC**: When executing external CLI utilities synchronously via `Process()`, **always** include `task.waitUntilExit()` (e.g. `/usr/bin/hidutil`, `/usr/bin/open`).
  - **Crucial Distinction**: NEVER execute a long-running GUI application binary directly with `Process().waitUntilExit()`, as this will synchronously block the main thread waiting for the application to terminate. Always delegate GUI launches to `/usr/bin/open` or `NSWorkspace.openApplication`.
  - Adhere to macOS Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for all SwiftUI views, menus, and HUD overlays.
  - Keep low-level `CGEvent` monitoring/filtering logic strictly separated in `Engine/` services away from SwiftUI Views.
  - **Always** ensure explicit accessibility permission checks (`AXIsProcessTrusted()`) before registering global event taps.
  - Gracefully handle event tap disablement events (`kCGEventTapDisabledByTimeout`, `kCGEventTapDisabledByUserInput`) by re-enabling the tap via `CGEvent.tapEnable(tap: true)`.
  - Instrument structured logs using `os.Logger(subsystem: "com.almosteleven.xomsky", category: ...)` rather than raw `print()` statements.
- **HUD Overlay Lifecycle & Dismissal Order**:
  - **Always hide the HUD overlay window (`MinimalHUDWindow.shared.hideImmediate()`) BEFORE triggering application activation or window focus**. External window launches cause macOS window server transitions that can swallow keyboard events and block the run loop, trapping the HUD on screen if hidden after the launch.
- **Pinned Apps & Universal Catalog Conventions**:
  - Enforce a hard ceiling of 4 pinned app slots. Single-app modes must hide the avatar row in the HUD to prevent visual noise.
  - Letter cycling must group apps deterministically by sanitized first letter.
  - **HUD Shortcut Transparency & Categorization**: Never hide conflicting same-letter application shortcuts in collapsed submenus or nested clicks. Render all apps assigned to the same key transparently with distinct badges, and cleanly demarcate pinned Toolset Shortcuts from dynamic Quick Shortcuts.
  - **System Application Bundle Resolution Guardrail**: Never assume macOS system applications exist in `/Applications`. Always resolve applications dynamically via `NSWorkspace.shared.urlForApplication(withBundleIdentifier:)` or query `/System/Applications` and `/System/Library/CoreServices` for core apps like Finder (`com.apple.finder`) and System Settings (`com.apple.systempreferences`).
- **App Name**: The application is **Xomsky**, never Khomyak. Always use `Xomsky` for the app name, docs, binaries, and releases.
- **Release Verification & Homebrew Cask Gate**:
  - In release pipelines, never update or publish a Homebrew Cask formula (`Casks/xomsky.rb`) until the GitHub release tag is pushed AND the GitHub Actions cloud build has successfully attached the DMG asset. Deterministically verify the remote URL with `curl -sI` and compute the SHA256 checksum directly from the published binary.
- **Concise Release Changelog Mandate**:
  - Whenever cutting, tagging, or announcing a new release, always compile and output a concise, structured bulleted list of changes (Changelog) directly in the release notes and user communication. Group updates into clear categories (`Features`, `Improvements`, `Fixes`, `Branding`), highlighting the tangible user-facing value in 1 sentence per item. Never publish a silent release without a summary.
- **Chromium Profile Automation Guardrail**:
  - **Never match Chromium windows by profile name or title substrings.**
  - **Always automate via native macOS menu bar (`kAXMenuBarAttribute`)**: Target the browser's "Profiles" menu bar item (`getProfilesMenuItems`), select items strictly by position/index, and detect the currently active profile using `AXMenuItemMarkChar == "✓"`.
- **Testing**:
  - Use the modern `Swift Testing` framework (`import Testing`, `@Test`, `#expect`) for all unit tests.
  - Unit tests live in `tests/ChromeQuickAccessTests/ChromeQuickAccessTests.swift`.
  - Tests must run deterministically in headless environments without real GUI spawning.
- **Bash Scripting**:
  - Use defensive bash patterns (`set -euo pipefail`) in all build, verification, and release scripts to prevent silent failures.
- **Telemetry & Bug Reporting UI**: Never auto-transmit telemetry. Do NOT rely on macOS `NSSharingService` (Share Sheet) as it fails to detect standalone apps like Telegram. Use a dual-path custom UI: (1) Draggable ZIP file for direct drag-and-drop into any messenger, and (2) GitHub Issue pre-filled button.
- **Zero Hardcoded Licensing**: Never hardcode Polar promotional codes or offline "giveaway" overrides in the Swift client application. All license validation must execute server-side.
- **Deterministic Buffer Sizing**: Never use arbitrary "magic numbers" for memory bounds, circular buffers, or cache sizes. Always justify the exact integer choice based on empirical calculations and document it.
- **Doubt-Driven Architecture**: Before implementing complex pipelines, explicitly pause to execute an adversarial self-critique. Actively seek out memory leaks, single points of failure, and UX edge cases before writing Swift code.
