# Chrome Quick Access Operations & Pipeline Management Guide

This skill governs the end-to-end management, maintenance, versioning, observability, and release lifecycle of Chrome Quick Access.

---

## 1. Pipeline Management Protocols

Whenever tasked with maintaining, updating, or releasing the application:

### Step 1: Quality Gate & Health Check
Always execute pre-flight diagnostics and verification before initiating any build or release:
```bash
make health
```
This runs the 3-point automated verification:
1. Version synchronization check between `VERSION.txt`, `BUILD.txt`, and `src/ChromeQuickAccess/Info.plist`.
2. Binary architecture verification (`arm64` + `x86_64` Mach-O universal slices in `dist/Chrome Quick Access.app`).
3. Automated test suite run (`./tests/run_tests.sh`).

### Step 2: Semantic Version Bumping
Never manually edit version numbers across disparate files. Use the automated semantic versioning commands:
```bash
make bump-patch  # Bug fixes, minor adjustments (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
make bump-minor  # New non-breaking features (e.g. 1.0.1 -> 1.1.0)
make bump-major  # Breaking architectural changes (e.g. 1.1.0 -> 2.0.0)
```
This automatically:
- Updates `VERSION.txt` and increments `BUILD.txt`.
- Updates `src/ChromeQuickAccess/Info.plist` (`CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion`) via `plutil`.

### Step 3: Local Builds & Packaging
```bash
# Build standalone universal app & DMG
make native

# Run test suite
make test

# Install locally to /Applications
make install
```

### Step 4: Release Execution & Cloud Automation
Chrome Quick Access supports automated cloud-native releases powered by GitHub Actions:

**Recommended: Cloud-Native Release via Git Tag**
1. Ensure the working tree is clean and version is bumped:
   ```bash
   make validate
   make health
   ```
2. Trigger the automated cloud release pipeline:
   ```bash
   ./release.sh --push
   # or manually:
   # git tag -a v$(cat VERSION.txt) -m "Release v$(cat VERSION.txt)"
   # git push origin v$(cat VERSION.txt)
   ```
   This triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` on GitHub Actions, which compiles the universal binary, runs health checks, generates SHA-256 checksums (`checksums.txt`), and automatically publishes a GitHub Release with all assets attached.

**Alternative: Local Fallback Release**
If releasing locally without cloud CI:
```bash
./release.sh --local
```

### Step 5: CI/CD Quality Gates & Artifact Delivery
The GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request and push to `main` across three isolated stages:
- **`lint-and-validate`**: Verifies version synchronization between `VERSION.txt`, `BUILD.txt`, and `Info.plist`, and lints all shell scripts.
- **`test`**: Independent fast-fail gate running the Swift Testing unit suite in <30 seconds.
- **`package`**: Compiles universal Mach-O binaries, packages the `.dmg` installer, computes SHA-256 hashes, and uploads downloadable artifacts (`ChromeQuickAccess-dmg`, 7-day retention) directly to the PR / workflow run.

## 2. Observability & Telemetry Instrumentation

The suite emits structured logs directly to the macOS Unified Logging System (`os_log`) under subsystem `com.unacau.chromequickaccess`.

### Architecture Subsystems:
- `app`: Application lifecycle, menu setup, and general state.
- `engine`: Caps-Lock hardware remapping and global event tap routing.
- `profiles`: Chromium `Local State` parsing, monogram rendering, and menu bar AX profile switching.
- `antigravity`: Antigravity & Antigravity IDE application discovery and switching.
- `copy-on-select`: Universal mouse drag and multi-click text selection copy engine.
- `hid`: `hidutil` hardware modifier mapping service.

### Telemetry Operations:
```bash
# Live stream real-time telemetry (all categories)
make monitor
# or
./scripts/monitor_telemetry.sh stream

# View aggregated category distribution & error rate
make diagnostics
# or
./scripts/monitor_telemetry.sh summary 1h

# Extract recent errors and faults (last 30 minutes)
./scripts/monitor_telemetry.sh errors 30m

# Export ndjson log records for log analytics ingestion
./scripts/monitor_telemetry.sh json 1h > telemetry.jsonl
```
